      Today we're updating our hate speech
      policy to ban Holocaust denial. We've long taken down posts that praise
      hate crimes or mass murder, including the Holocaust. But with rising
      anti-Semitism, we're expanding our policy to prohibit any content that
      denies or distorts the Holocaust as well. If people search for the
      Holocaust on Facebook, weâ€™ll start directing you to authoritative sources
      to get accurate information. I've struggled with the tension between
      standing for free expression and the harm caused by minimizing or denying
      the horror of the Holocaust. My own thinking has evolved as I've seen data
      showing an increase in anti-Semitic violence, as have our wider policies
      on hate speech. Drawing the right lines between what is and isn't
      acceptable speech isn't straightforward, but with the current state of the
      world, I believe this is the right balance.
